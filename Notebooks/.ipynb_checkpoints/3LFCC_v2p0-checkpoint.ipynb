    "## Abstract\n",
    "Our project focuses on designing and implementing high voltage re-sizable transistors for a DC-DC buck converter demonstrator based on the three-level flying capacitor converter (3LFCC) architecture, a simple but versatile type of flying-capacitor multi-level (FCML) converter, using the Skywater 130nm CMOS technology (SKY130). This notebook shows the main steps of the analog design flow, namely simulation, layout, verification and post-layout simulation of a single converter core, based on the requirements that the user has given as input.\n"

    "\n",
    "Recent development in miniaturization of satellites have led to the widespread of the CubeSat standard. These applications have serious volume and weight restrictions and could greatly benefit from fully-integrating DC-DC converters, as they tend to be bulky and heavy. Figure 1 shows the different converters stages in the electronic power system of a CubeSat, where versatile topologies like FCML could prove to be convenient. High current density, reversibility and small passive devices are some of the major challenges. \n",

    "Through this Notebook, it will be shown in simulation that a single converter core based on 3-L architecture can achieve high levels of efficiency at the targeted loads. It is worth noting that this simulation is considering an external passive filter and flying capacitor, but also some inductances for representing the connections to the chip as such. The layout of the core is built using **.tcl** scripts and the simulations are made in **NGSpice**. The simulation results are then processed through **Python** scripts.\n",

    "### 1.1 About the converter and its implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3LFCC used is implemented as a buck converter, having 4 important states, depicted in figure **2**. Depending on the desired voltage output at the load, the rate of appearence of this states will change. When the voltage is higher than $\\frac{V_{DD}}{2}$, state 3 won't appear and state 0 will appear twice, but when the voltage is lower than $\\frac{V_{DD}}{2}$, the opposite will happen. Voltages in between those ranges will vary the duty cycle of the PWM that feed the switches.\n",

The Notebook workflow is present in figure **2**.\n",

    "### 2.2 Design choices and device characterizations\n",
    "\n",
    "For a design to be made, it was necessary to first choose and characterize the devices on their own. For the transistors, the hybrid waffle layout was the best option. This is because a converter was fabricated and tested in the Open PMIC for the current levels that are desired for the converter using them, assuring that the IC will perform as needed.\n",
    "Other benefits of using this particular layout is that it can handle higher currents and have better switching resistance for bigger areas, in comparison of using traditional finger layouts.\n",
    "After choosing the devices, they were characterized by doing Post Layout simulations. By using the testing setup shown in **(3)** (example for a NMOS setup with $V_{GS}=5V$), the switching resistances and drain-source currents were determined for various multiplicities. \n",
